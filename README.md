# FacialFilters
A simple application created using OpenCV which applies selected filters to the face.


The project gives user choice to select the filter and then applies it accordingly. 
The image resolution can deteriorate specially for the eye detection as the image will be compressed heavily for the sake of avoiding the scaling error. 
The problem will be neglegible for the face detection. Therefore, the source files should be selected carefully.
